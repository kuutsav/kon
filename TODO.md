- show tokens streamed in for bash, edit and write tools (which can large at times)
- if @ or / menu is open pressing esc closes it but interrupts stream as well
- bug in how we report context size, tokens in and out and cached tokens for codex?
- steer (immediate) and normal queues
- easily attach previous chats as truncated context?
- amp inspired /handoff <instructions>, like branching in pi?
- skills triggered manually from /cmds
- session stats on +x -y lines per file/overall
